        "title": "Scientists Begin to Unravel Gigantic Space Ribbon",
        "description": "<p>In 2009 astronomers using NASA’s Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft accidentally came across a giant ribbon-like formation snaking its way across the boundary between our solar system and interstellar space. Ever since, its true nature has remained a riddle astronomers have been unable to solve. But now, they believe they are a step closer to explaining this bizarre structure.</p><p>The solar system—the sun and all its planets—is surrounded by a protective magnetic bubble-like boundary called the heliosphere, which acts as a frontline against incoming cosmic rays and interstellar clouds. The science team had been using IBEX to construct the first-ever all-sky map of the interactions occurring at the edge of the solar system when they came across this puzzling ribbon that appears across much of the heliosphere.</p><p>While the ribbon doesn’t give off any light, for some unknown reason it emits copious amounts of particles, called energetic neutral atoms, towards the Sun—much more than the surrounding areas do. IBEX can pick up these emissions billions of miles away from Earth orbit, and use them to map the ribbon’s structure.</p><p>More than a dozen theories have been put forth to try and explain why mathematical models of the ribbon structure just didn’t quite match what astronomers were seeing (ie. ribbon is actually thicker than it should be according to theory). But now the IBEX science team thinks they have come up with an explanation that begins to explain their observations.</p><p>The new theory suggests that this ribbon sits in a particular location at the heliosphere where the solar wind from the Sun crosses the galactic magnetic field. The outward-bound neutral hydrogen atoms that make up this solar wind bounce off the boundary and form gyrating charged ions that create waves in the magnetic field.</p><p>The resulting particles stream back inward and form the ribbon of energized neutral atoms.</p><p><i>“This is a perfect example of the scientific process,”</i> said David McComas, co-author on the study and the team leader for the IBEX mission, in a statement.</p><p><i>“We observe something completely new and unexpected with IBEX, develop various hypotheses to explain the observations, and then develop mathematical models to try to validate the hypotheses.”</i></p><p>While scientists believe they have finally begun to answer questions surrounding the astrophysical nature of this gigantic ribbon of energy—its origins still largely remain a mystery. Stay tuned…</p>",

        "description": "<p>Like the undead monsters in a Hollywood movie, some science theories just keep coming back to life. That’s been the case with solving the mystery surrounding the sudden disappearance 13,000 years ago of the Clovis – a Paleo-Indian North American culture.  A popular theory keeps getting resurrected which fingers a comet impact in the Great Lakes region as the culprit .</p><p>The resulting air-burst from the collision would have plunged North American continent into a snap deep freeze and glacial period- which would have spelled doom for the Clovis, says the theory.</p><p>But now, researchers from over a dozen institutions across Europe and the U.S. hope they have finally shot this theory down for good.</p><p><i>“The theory has reached zombie status,”</i> said co-author of the study, Andrew Scott from Royal Holloway,University of London in a press release. <i>“Whenever we are able to show flaws and think it is dead, it reappears with new, equally unsatisfactory, arguments.”</i></p><p>The Clovis was a culture known for advanced stone tools, and  evidence has long suggested that they appeared to suddenly vanish off the face of the Earth . This led to the hypothesis that the entire society may have met their demise due to some sort of a major catastrophic event. But according to the new study, it looks like it wasn’t any cosmic collision.</p><p><i>“There’s no plausible mechanism to get air-bursts over an entire continent,”</i> said lead author Mark Boslough, a physicist at the Sandia National Laboratories in NewMexico in a statement. <i>“For this and other reasons, we conclude that the impact hypothesis is, unfortunately, bogus.”</i></p><p>The researchers rebuttal is based on the lack of both an appropriately sized impact crater and shocked material in sediments. Also they contend that samples presented in support of the impact hypothesis were contaminated with modern material.</p><p><i>“Hopefully new versions of the theory will be more carefully examined before they are published”</i>,  added Scott.</p><p>Instead of disappearing the researchers believe the Clovis simply made a natural shift towards becoming another culture known as the Folsoms. Further research will need to be done however to pin down the exact reasons for the disappearance of the Clovis.</p><p><i>“Just because a culture changed from Clovis to Folsom spear points didn’t mean their civilization collapsed,”</i> added Boslough. <i>“They probably just used another technology. It’s like saying the phonograph culture collapsed and was replaced by the iPod culture.”</i></p>",

        "description": "<p>Reports of Iran successfully launching a grey rhesus monkey into space this week has been making a splash online, but it’s only the latest in a long line of unwitting participants in humankind’s exploration of outer space. While many question the veracity of this news, it does make us think of the significant role animals have played in humankind’s push towards the final frontier.  A menagerie of species has been hitching a ride to the great unknown since the dawn of the space age; from microbes and fruit flies to apes and canines.</p><p>In 1959 a squirrel monkey named Baker was one of the first primates to survive a trip into space. She lived until 1984. Photograph courtesy NASA.</p><p>Before the first astronaut left the bonds of Earth, researchers felt they needed to have large mammals like dogs and primates to be our testers to determine if it was even possible to survive the high gravitational forces and the weightless environment of space.  The first animals to make it into space were actually fruit flies aboard a U.S. modified V2 rocket in 1947 and a rhesus monkey the following year.  Both were sub-orbital flights but it was the Russia’s dog cosmonaut Laika that became the first animal to orbit the Earth on November 3, 1957. Unfortunately the hapless pup did not survive the historic trip.</p><p>Much has changed since we first started strapping animals and ourselves into space bound rockets. Flash forward 50 plus years later and more than 500 humans have earned their astronaut wings and even space tourism looks like it might be around the corner. Much more rigid research policies are in place at national space agencies which govern animal use making sure they are put into service only when necessary and do get treated humanely.</p><p>There is no need to send primates or man’s best friend because we humans are for the most part now the guinea pigs of choice.  So in this light  Iran’s monkey mission this week is more than  60 years behind its time and seen as more of a PR stunt than anything else.</p><p>While suiting up chimps is a thing of the past, we still do rely on many kinds of creatures to conduct essential physiological research destined to help in expanding human space exploration beyond Earth orbit. But due to practical reasons and housing needs on spacecraft like the now-retired space shuttle, resupply cargo ships, and the International Space Station, they are much lower-ordered species like fish, frogs, and insects that are selected as passengers.</p><p>Scientists can use sophisticated computer models and astronauts themselves; however there are certain kinds of experiments that would be a burden on space crews and be impractical—like those that require strictly monitored, long-term daily diets for example. These days, other than humans, mice are the most complex organisms being lofted into low Earth orbit—staying for weeks at a time onboard the space laboratory.</p><p>Unique data can obtained from how these small mammals cope with microgravity conditions that can be directly applied to humans, helping to solve medical problems both in space and on Earth. For example a recent experiment on one of the final flights of the space shuttle leveraged the microgravity environment of space to investigate bone loss in mice.  Accelerated aging of the skeleton with bones becoming brittle without the pull of gravity is just one of many medical challenges (ex. muscle atrophy and space radiation) facing future human crews on multi-year deep space missions like those to the planet Mars.  But there are also more down to Earth potential spinoffs too—like developing more effective drugs to fight the bone degenerative disease of osteoporosis seen in the elderly.</p><p>Animals are not sent into space often anymore because of cheaper, more efficient alternatives but many biological experiments still being conducted are giving scientists invaluable insight about the challenges space can pose to life and how to solve them. When the time comes that we live permanently in space and head out across the solar system, it will be thanks to the multitude of animals that gave their service, and lives in many cases, in the name of advancing space exploration.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Armchair astronomers take note: This space atlas is for you.  Yes, that kind of atlas—a series of maps and charts that evokes the ability to navigate a place, usually by ship or some sort of vehicle.  In this case all you need is imagination.</p><p>Several years in the making, National Geographic’s Space Atlas features 47 new maps and diagrams, including the major moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.  In many cases the maps are remarkably detailed; Mercury’s surface incorporates the latest data from the orbiting Messenger spacecraft.</p><p>The crater names on the first planet might surprise you: Mark Twain, Botticelli, Dali, Shakespeare.  There’s a massive impact site called Beethoven Basin.  Mercury’s craters, it turns out, are named for artists, authors, composers, and painters.</p><p>On Venus nearly every feature is named after goddesses or famous women—Ishtar, O’Keeffe, Boleyn, Joliot-Curie. </p> <p>Cartographer Matt Chwastyk worked with NASA scientists to pull together volumes of data to create the maps.  His favorite part of the atlas?  <i>“The moons, definitely,”</i> he says.  <i>“These are places that no one’s ever likely to step foot on, and we’ve mapped them out.”</i></p><h3>BEYOND PLANETS AND STARS</h3><p>From the planets and moons of our solar system, the atlas extends outward to stars in the Milky Way and celestial phenomena like supernovae and black holes.  The life and death of stars are discussed, along with theories about the universe’s origin and expansion.</p><p><i>“This isn’t just about astronomy, it’s all the sciences,”</i> says Jim Trefil, author of the atlas and Clarence J. Robinson Professor of Physics at George Mason University.  <i>“Our view of the world is getting deeper and more detailed because we have computers now that can handle the data.”</i></p><p><i>“Everything you can see is as most 5 percent of the universe,”</i> he adds.  <i>“The rest is dark matter and dark energy.  We didn’t know about either of them 30 years ago.”</i></p><p>The final section of the atlas covers the universe at large.  If you want a real sense of perspective, be sure to look at the nesting sequence at the start of this section.  You see our solar system as part of a local star cluster, then zip out to the cluster’s location in the Milky Way and its local galaxy group, which in turn belongs to a galactic supercluster.</p><h3>EDGE OF THE UNKNOWN</h3><p>And what of the nature of the universe itself?  Picture this possibility: our universe as a bubble that’s expanding (via a mysterious force called dark energy) and shedding smaller bubbles at the surface as it does.  Each smaller bubble then becomes its own universe.</p><p><i>“The idea of lots of parallel universes is incredibly intriguing,”</i> says Trefil.  <i>“It’s a very different way of looking at the universe.  We’ve had notions of parallel universes before, but now we have a good theoretical basis—string theory.”</i></p><p>Asked what he would want to know if he could have one question about the universe answered, Trefil replies, <i>“What is dark energy?  It controls the whole future of the universe.”</i></p>",

        "description": "<p>Whenever someone meets me, it doesn’t take them long to ask me the question, <i>“How did you get so into space?”</i> Given that I’ve likely just worked the space shuttle into a conversation about owls or mentioned a solar flare as part of ordering a pizza, it’s not surprising.</p><p>It could have been all the episodes of Buck Rogers, Battlestar Galactica (the original), and Space 1999 I watched as a kid, or the memory I have of standing in our kitchen watching a lunar eclipse out the window while my father explained each step with an apple and an orange.</p><p>But in 1983, at the age of eight, I moved to the Fiji Islands with my family, and something took it to the next level. I saw brilliant stars and the Milky Way in a way I never had before. My father pointed out the first satellite I’d ever seen cruising across the night sky. There was no TV, so I read books like 2010 Space Odyssey and Contact.</p><p>That summer I was sitting on the floor of our house in Suva and an announcement came on the nightly radio news. The first American woman, Sally Ride, just flew in space.</p><p>I knew from that moment forward that I would also someday fly in space. Somehow, she made it possible.</p><p>She became synonymous with women’s achievements in space and science and with my own path to making that possible. When I went to college and struggled between my love for science and my love for communicating, I chose English Literature as my major all the while thinking, <i>“Sally Ride got a degree in English, it still means I can be an astronaut, right?”</i></p><p>Two years ago, I took my first step and flew in zero gravity aboard the ZeroG plane. As my hair floated in a halo around my face, I thought of Sally Ride and those first images of her on the shuttle.</p><p>I admired how she was willing to hold NASA accountable to the highest standards of conduct, participating in both the space shuttle Challenger and Columbia review boards. Her dedication to space education, but particularly encouraging young girls to follow that path, made her an inspiration even after a relatively short career with NASA.</p><p>Sadly, I never got to meet her. Given how young she was, I always thought there would be time. But she will continue to inspire others, and I know I will think of her when I eventually make it into orbit.</p>",
