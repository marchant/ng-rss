Red-robed Kyrgyz girls corral sheep for milking, while dung dries atop the walls for use as fuel. The sheep, along with goats, yaks, and camels, provide milk, meat, and wool and even serve as currency: One lamb buys 110 pounds of flour.",

There was no aurora that night, but there was high humidity, so the light from the city was reflected over the entire sky, even though we were well away from the city. Instead of the usual gold or orange glow, the sky took on a red hue that was clearly visible to the naked eye.",
